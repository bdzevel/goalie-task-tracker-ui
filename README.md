Goalie UI
=====

A to-do list application written in JavaScript, for practice. This is the front end code.

1) React.JS
* ReactJS is the framework used here
* Flux used for architecture
* npm used to manage external packages
* Resulting code is browserify-ed and minified, then must be copied to the public location it's to be served from

NOTE: Other frameworks may additionally be used and added in this project in the future. For example, Angular2 might be added once it's stable.
